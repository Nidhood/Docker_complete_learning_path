Â¿What's a container attached mode a detached mode?

-> Attached mode = The docker container run is attached to the current terminal (can't commit any commands and is the default), which also means we are listening to all inputs that get in the container.
-> Detached mode = The docker container run is not attached to the current terminal (we can keep committing commands in the current terminal), we will not be able to see logs from the container.

* "docker logs -f [container ID or container name]" -> Print the posted logs in the current terminal from the specified container and keep them attached to the terminal, listening for more logs.

* "docker run -it [cointainer ID or container name]" -> Allow to wait for inputs.

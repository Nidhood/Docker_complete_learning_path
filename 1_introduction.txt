What it's docker?

->  Docker is a container technology, a tool for 
    creating and managing containers.

What it's container?

->  Container is a standardized unit of software, 
    a package of code and dependencies to run that code.

->  Can be used in any machine, always where de docker is
    installed.

What it's the advantage of using docker?

->  The same containers always yields the exact same 
    application and execution behaviur! No matter where 
    or by whom it might be executed.
->  We ensure reliability & reproducible environments.

Why would we want independent, standardized "application" and packages?

->  Different Development & Production Environment.
->  We want to build and test in exactly the same 
    environment we later run our app in.
->  Different Development Environment Within a Team 
    / Company.
->  Clashing Tools / Versions Between Different Projects.

What is the difference between docker and virtual machines?

->  Virtual machines creates inside your Operating System 
    a Virtual OS, but having a lot of VM will implicate
    wastes a lot of space on the hard drive and tends 
    to be slow.

->  Less waste of memory space on the hard drive, more 
    flexible to be shared and more fastest to be 
    configured and runned.

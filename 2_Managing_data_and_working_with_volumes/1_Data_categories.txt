What category of data exists inside a container?

    * Application (code + environment):     Is the data added to the image and container in the build phase, 
                                            we're working with Read-only data, hence stored in images.

    * Temporary App Data (e.g. entered user input):     Stored in memory for temporary files, dynamic changing, but cleared regularly. 
                                                        This data is Read + write, temporary, hence stored in the container.

    * Permanent App Data (e.g. user accounts):  Stored in files or a database, must not be lost if containers stop/restart. 
                                                Read + write, permanent, stored with containers & volumes.

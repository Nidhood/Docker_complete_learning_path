What is a bind mount?

->  This is similar to the volumes, but instead of leaving docker let's save the persistent 
    data inside the volume where we don't know its location in our host's machine, the bind
    mount specify the path or the file structure where this persistent data will be saved on 
    our host machine.

->  So the bind mount is great for persistent, editable (by us) data (e.g. source code).

How can I search for my absolute path?

-> macOS/Linux: -v $(pwd):/app

-> Windows:     -v "%cd%":/app
